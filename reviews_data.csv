1,"Foram",5,"Data Science Complete Guide","2023-10-10","Data science is a vast field and what everyone mostly struggles with is wrapping their head around what all to study and how to prepare for it. This book covers everything with some real world tips that you will need to be successful. Don’t think and just buy it.",1
2,"CHANG LIU",5,"Very helpful!","2023-10-06","It's an amazing book for candidates in data science to prepare not only the coding part, but also conceptual and situational questions, it is truly useful as data science interviews normally cover a much wider range of topics compared to engineering interviews. Preparing DS interviews just became a lot easier and more structured because of this book.",1
3,"Sam",5,"Comprehensive for most Data Scientist Interviews","2023-09-11","As someone that conducts data science interviews, I still reference this book when applying for my own new positions and when encountering different interview styles. Caveat I'm not from a FAANG background but I see extremely different approaches to data science technical interviews. A book like this is help for most of them but if you are going for something like ML Engineering you'll find the book lacks reference in system design topics.",1
4,"Amazon Customer",5,"Practical and current","2023-09-24","Finished reading the first half of the book. Great for those who just started out paving their ways into data science!",1
5,"samit",4,"All the important topics in one book","2023-07-31","The book covers all the important topics needed for data science interview, but the explanation seems to be similar to original books. They have written the explanation with real world examples in a way so that it can be discussed simply during the interview.",1
6,"Jinsong",5,"Comprehensive Book","2023-08-31","The book is comprehensive and covers a wide breadth of topics. That being said, the book is an overall excellent guide to prepare for interviews by touching on various topics and offering abundant example questions!",1
7,"Shivaani Krishnakumar",4,"Love this book and highly recommend it","2023-07-21","My most favorite part of this book is the case study! I always like to think through a problem from a business perspective and not just the technical aspect since in python everything is available as libraries, technical side becomes pretty straightforward. Each of the case studies in this book were gold <3",1
8,"Allen Xu",5,"Verified Purchase - Works as recommended","2023-08-16","The book gives good structure and understanding of how much understanding is needed in respective areas so that candidates are not lost or feeling overwhelmed with all the Data Science and ML/AI informantion out there",1
9,"Maggie",5,"Helpful for all DS majors","2023-08-16","This book contains everything I need to know and gives me a broad picture of how to prepare my interviews. Highly recommend! There are also many tips that are very crucial during interviews.",1
10,"Suresh Mallina",5,"Loved the practice questions","2023-08-01","Very well thought out and helpful book when preparing for ds/ data analytics interviews. I thought the explanations for sample questions were very thorough and the frameworks provided for answering product sense questions were useful.",1

The book I received has the cover for SQL for Data Analysis...but the book/pages contained inside is for AWS Cookbook by John Culkin....so...don't judge a book by it's cover....",4
14,"Amazon Customer",2,"Organization is lacking","2022-09-11","I'm just starting out, and I'm finding the little examples in Ch. 2 meaningless without accompanying databases/code exercises.  Perhaps they'll be more meaningful with sample databases that are given later in the text.  That's offputting considering there is a GitHub repository.  Why not take full advantage of supplemental resources to make the examples more meaningful?",4

16,"Guillem Clot Massons",5,"","2022-03-12","Good guide to understand SQL and all its possibilities, mostly when nowadays Python and R hog all data analysis studies. However the scope of this book doesn't go beyond RDBS, so streaming (like KafkaSql) or text engines (like ElasticSearch using sql) are not mentioned.",4

18,"Ryan D.",5,"The Aha Moment","2023-10-08","I wish I found this book sooner for my ML AI coursework.  This book has made such a difference in my comprehension of statistics and its concepts.  I purchased his two other books out of faith that they too would get me where I need to be with hypothesis testing and regression.",5
19,"Robert A. Saunders",3,"Mostly good, but flawed","2023-07-31","The book is missing some key formulas, as well as data to support a particular example. There is no discussion of the Poisson distribution.",5
20,"T",5,"Focus on concepts and practices to perform analysis and correctly interpret results","2022-10-02","Found Mr. Jim Frost’s incredibly helpful blog first, then discovered he has also published books for further understanding. Well-written for the novice or advanced reader interested in statistics, hypothesis testing, analyzing data, other. Arranged so your choice of statistical software can be used to handle the calculations (equations can be found in most textbooks if desired), you get right into learning concepts and practices needed to know how to perform the analysis and interpret results correctly.",5

He's a famous Stats blogger at statisticsbyhim.com and his writing is super friendly, easy to read, easy to understand, and enjoyable, which is all quite impressive for the topic of Statistics. This book is a blend of what you learn in the classroom and what you use in practice. As a Stats teacher, I find it immensely helpful. It's also a great book for students and those in industry.

28,"M. Bryant",4,"nothing new with data science, but does show you how to ""game"" kaggle","2023-06-02","This won't teach you anything new if you already have formal data science/ML teaching and experience, it may show you a few packages here and there you may not be familiar with, but there are better ways to stay on top of new things. Otherwise, this book does what the authors claim. It gives you strategies to ""game"" the system in Kaggle and give you an edge. The authors claim many times in the book , ""this wouldn't work in a real life situation""... which is good. This book is about kaggle and how to win, but if you were expecting something eye opening with regards to data science and machine learning you will be somewhat disappointed. If you are new to data science, this would be a good resource as long as you understand that some things shouldn't  be done in the real world.",6
29,"Vicente Bramadasbull",5,"Ideal for beginners in data science","2023-08-08","Kaggle is a great platform, but not knowing how to take advantage of it from the first minute can be the worst mistake you can make. This book is excellent since it addresses critical issues that are often overlooked by beginners.",6
30,"Matthew Emerick",5,"From Kaggle to Career in One Book","2022-04-22","I was wary of reading this book, let alone reviewing it.  I've seen a LOT of people who are so into Kaggle that they don't understand that real-world data is FAR messier, complicated, and requires a lot of work before you get to the fun of modeling. I didn't want my review to help fuel more of that thinking.",6
31,"Data Science Director",5,"Rich, informative text.","2022-12-05","I've read this cover to cover and I think it's a great book, and it's worth a read. Winning something on Kaggle is notoriously difficult (especially these days), but this book offers a glimpse into the minds of Kaggle Grandmasters. Is there a secret sauce? Not really. It's just a lot of hard work. What particularly I liked about this book? I really liked chapters on hyperparameters tuning, chapter on ensembling, tabular chapter is pretty good, and I liked data augmentation for NLP (it's rare!). I hope this helps!",6

37,"Adu",5,"A great book for people want to start Kaggle","2022-07-14","Kaggle is the most famous data science competition platform. Personally I started Kaggle around 2017 and since that I have learnt a lot of machine learning techniques through participating the competitions on Kaggle. As a student at that time, the biggest challenge for students learning machine learning algorithms is there is no good way to get your hand dirty: it is very difficult to get real-world dataset and work on a real world machine learning problem. Kaggle closed this gap by introducing a data science competition hosted by industry leaders with real world dataset.",6
38,"eltjim",4,"Product great–Amazon packaging not so much","2022-08-01","Great book, delivered on time. Unfortunately, whoever packed it at the fulfillment center neglected to pad it with paper or sealed air pillows. As a result, the front cover was damaged (creased).",7

48,"R. Geist",4,"a really good solid start in how to look at numerical data and avoid falling into common interpretative pit falls.","2013-01-15","I got the book promptly.  It has that softbound textbook feel.  but good binding not cheap or ready to fall apart.  the intormation in it so far seems interesting and well organized.  its in the ""head first format"" which means there is a lot of nice visual lay out and side notes and some graphics to make understanding the concepts by seeing them when possible.  I like that format.  It is still pretty clean and gets to the point.  but I have only read and used so much of it at this point so I cannot go much farther into the content than that.  -- in short I think it is a solid book to get if one wants to better understand how to interpret social science numbers,  or other scientific numbers that they are shown in a way that they are wise to various ways that data can be spiked and spiced.  how in depth I cannot comment on as I have not fully digested the book.  But it is a book that is designed to be both read and used as a topical reference.  And it has the ""Head First"" style keeping things clean but providing insightful commentary, context and graphical illustrations where it might really speed up or enhance understanding of a particular idea or complicated example.  it also uses bolding in areas where you can pay attention to the new vocabulary you might want to learn in order to lay the ground work for even more technical education in data analysis.  it even has a chapter where it goes over some of the more obscure plug ins for excel that are there for helping a person analyze data.  I would basically treat this book as a nice survey of both the human technical sides of data analysis.  it also covers things like data collection or effective data presentation,  and as I said it refers to several readily available tools like excel for example and how they can be used by someone who wanted to know how to leverage their computer in order tame and extract meaning from data they have been given to interpret.  -- I think that its a useful primer  that is like a survey course in the subject sans the professor.  But how good each section is I cannot comment on as I have only started with the book for a several weeks.  but  what I did read I found completely intelligible and because I am not a total novice at looking at Data,  there were times I could use its nice formatting to skip past explanations I did not need because I already was familiar with them.  If I fall in love with the book I may come back and say so and make my stars 5 instead of a 4 but at this point I would highly recommend this book for anyone who wanted a nice primer that went into to a very serviceable level of detail for a primer or survey type information source.",8
49,"Onlydole",5,"Wonderful Starting Point","2013-01-19","This was a beautiful book that really refueled my interest for Statistics (which I've been struggling to start learning...even though I know calculus and LOVE mathematics)...but it really caught my eye because it goes into detail about the R statistical programming language.",8

52,"amayong",4,"Great Introduction to Applied Analysis","2010-11-25","This book provides an excellent, approachable introduction to data analysis. Although most experienced professionals or advanced students will find this text trivial, it serves as a god starting point for those who are completely new to data analysis. The text provides numerous interactive examples using Excel and R, but the examples do not cover these tools in any great depth. If you're looking to learn more about statistics, data analysis and data mining, this book is a good starting point.",8
53,"Ms. R. M.",3,"Content (that I can see) is good, but print is washed out on some pages.","2012-06-24","The book itself is useful. I like the way it takes the reader through one example problem at a time and guides the thought process needed to solve the problem. The only thing I don't like is that the print is so faint on some of the pages that I can hardly read it. It looks like a bad printing job or like the presses were running out of ink when this book was created. Some of the screen shots are so washed out (very pale gray color) that I can't see what I am suppose to click on.",8
54,"Gregory A. Stobbs",2,"Too much fluff","2011-02-15","While some of the Head First series have been quite helpful, this one has way too much fluff, making it tedious to find the important content.  By way of example, the entire page 97 is devoted to ""Profits fell through the floor"" with a picture of a sad person, a picture of a pile of rubber ducks, a sample letter expressing a complaint, and the conclusion that ""this is pretty bad news."" Page 97 lies in the middle of the ""optimization"" chapter, but you don't get to the punch line on what to do about the ""pretty bad news"" until page 108. The pace of the book is simply too slow--which I attribute to an overuse of the Head First style, a style supposedly ""designed for the way your brain works."" My brain would have been happier if the editors had picked up the pace.",8
55,"Elke Blinick",5,"Great Introduction into various Data Analysis Tools and Techniques","2012-09-19","Different problems need different methods to be solved properly. This book takes various examples and lets the reader work through the problems. It is actually fun to read this book. Very well explained. Of course, not all the problems worked 100%, but I have not read a book with examples and problems that all work. Especially, some of my R did not work too well.

My issue is that I was unable to get the author's SQL script file (LoadSQLServer.sql) to properly to set up the downloadable data files into SQL Server. I'm running SQL Server on a Mac and I think the author did all his work on a Windows-based PC.  My suggestion would be to devote a chapter or two in the next edition explaining how to get started with SQL Server in BOTH Windows and OS X environments.

72,"Michael Berry",5,"Second Edition is Even Better than the First","2016-02-16","I buy a copy of this book for each new hire in my small analytics group. My most recent purchase was of the Second Edition which is a noticeable improvement on the excellent First Edition which I have already reviewed very favorably. Many of the queries have been reworked to be more readable by using common table expressions. The index is better which is important because I often tell someone something like ""There's a great example of using window functions for that somewhere in Linoff's book"" and now they have a better chance of finding the example I have in mind.  There is also a welcome new chapter on performance issues. The most important strength of this book remains the same: It shows SQL the way it is actually used for business analysis. I don't think there is a single INSERT or UPDATE statement in the book, and that's fine because we rarely use them in our line of work. On the other hand, there are many examples of things we do all the time such as creating histograms to explore distributions, creating lookup tables, and calculating distance or similarity.",11

I didn't need to know how tables were made or populated or how to write simple SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE queries.

But these aren't really valid considering that the book's focus is more to teach you how to use excel to implement these concepts rather than the reverse. One could say it's geared towards the former with a little bit of the latter mixed in.

In his explanation of charting, the author draws a good analogy from his past vacation to help the reader understand the important of different scales in chart axes.  The author was personable and genuine in making his point stick with the reader.  The book then does a good job in explaining the difference between random sampling methods and special cases in which sampling is not possible. It also discusses strategies for overcoming the presence of confounding variables.  Overall, it’s a good read and helps solidify important concepts.

In case you are thinking about participating in Kaggle competitions or already have, you should get this book. The book cannot guarantee that you'll win the competition. After all, winning requires a lot of creative thinking. But using common practices will definitely help you climb the leaderboard. The book is the first of its kind and I would definitely buy it for my home library. Often overly detailed, this is a great practical guide for Kaggle competitions, including Kaggle platform overview, many lines of Python code, strategies and best practices. It does not discuss machine learning algorithms or machine learning theory in general; for that, you should look for specialized machine learning theory books. However, the authors provide a list of most popular algorithms used in competitions, as well as their key features and most important parameters. The chapters about Bayesian Optimization and Blending/Stacking are probably the best I have seen so far. The book has a lot of blurbs with interviews from Kagglers, which is the most entertaining part for me. In my opinion, these blurbs can be converted to another great book. In spite of the fact that this book is fantastic now, I expect it to become outdated pretty quickly given the level of details provided by the authors and the pace at which machine learning is progressing. It would be wise for the authors to consider a new edition when it becomes outdated. I would recommend this book to people who are interested in machine learning competitions and are familiar with machine learning theory.",6

My computer science friends are even surprised by how much I was able to learn about this programming language that they consider impossible in such a short amount of time. I highly recommend this product if you have any interest at all in learning a new programming language or just giving yourself another skill because they make it very simple to learn.

It's a shame that it's just short of a reference work. A colleague showed me how to use the ""UNION"" command. That does not appear in this book at all. There are only a handful of such queries missing, so it's a shame that it doesn't cover all of them. It would have been good to have had a list of all of the commands, with a short explanation, even if using them was out of the scope of this book.  If you set aside a day of uninterrupted time you could get through this book in a day and have a great grounding, then search the internet for a full list of functions and read up on the functions not covered here.",19

It also gives you challenge tasks to complete, relevant to the the topic you will have covered. It has all the solutions at the back for reference where you may have gone wrong, and you could redo the assignment until you master. I have read so many SQL books, but they never give you projects to practice what you have learned. It has solidified my knowledge on SQL. It covers exhaustively what you would expect in a working environment. However, I just missed the stored procedures,  but has Views which close to stored procedures.

It has that softbound textbook feel.  but good binding not cheap or ready to fall apart.  the intormation in it so far seems interesting and well organized.  its in the ""head first format"" which means there is a lot of nice visual lay out and side notes and some graphics to make understanding the concepts by seeing them when possible.  I like that format.  It is still pretty clean and gets to the point.  but I have only read and used so much of it at this point so I cannot go much farther into the content than that.  -- in short I think it is a solid book to get if one wants to better understand how to interpret social science numbers,  or other scientific numbers that they are shown in a way that they are wise to various ways that data can be spiked and spiced.  how in depth I cannot comment on as I have not fully digested the book.  But it is a book that is designed to be both read and used as a topical reference.  And it has the ""Head First"" style keeping things clean but providing insightful commentary, context and graphical illustrations where it might really speed up or enhance understanding of a particular idea or complicated example.  it also uses bolding in areas where you can pay attention to the new vocabulary you might want to learn in order to lay the ground work for even more technical education in data analysis.  it even has a chapter where it goes over some of the more obscure plug ins for excel that are there for helping a person analyze data.  I would basically treat this book as a nice survey of both the human technical sides of data analysis.  it also covers things like data collection or effective data presentation,  and as I said it refers to several readily available tools like excel for example and how they can be used by someone who wanted to know how to leverage their computer in order tame and extract meaning from data they have been given to interpret.  -- I think that its a useful primer  that is like a survey course in the subject sans the professor.  But how good each section is I cannot comment on as I have only started with the book for a several weeks.  but  what I did read I found completely intelligible and because I am not a total novice at looking at Data,  there were times I could use its nice formatting to skip past explanations I did not need because I already was familiar with them.  If I fall in love with the book I may come back and say so and make my stars 5 instead of a 4 but at this point I would highly recommend this book for anyone who wanted a nice primer that went into to a very serviceable level of detail for a primer or survey type information source.",8

Page 97 lies in the middle of the ""optimization"" chapter, but you don't get to the punch line on what to do about the ""pretty bad news"" until page 108.

Many of the queries have been reworked to be more readable by using common table expressions. The index is better which is important because I often tell someone something like ""There's a great example of using window functions for that somewhere in Linoff's book"" and now they have a better chance of finding the example I have in mind.  There is also a welcome new chapter on performance issues. The most important strength of this book remains the same: It shows SQL the way it is actually used for business analysis. I don't think there is a single INSERT or UPDATE statement in the book, and that's fine because we rarely use them in our line of work.

The book begins by teaching you about what the program is, how it is becoming a valued skill in the world, and why it is a better programming language than others. It makes a language that most people consider highly advanced and more and more difficult the more you use it very easy to grasp in a way that could potentially change your entire career. I am not a computer science expert myself and have only a basic understanding of programming language, mostly java, but I was able to read this book and understand almost all of it without a problem. My computer science friends are even surprised by how much I was able to learn about this programming language that they consider impossible in such a short amount of time. I highly recommend this product if you have any interest at all in learning a new programming language or just giving yourself another skill because they make it very simple to learn.",19

This book does a great job of providing the basics of SQL query writing and gives good explanations. The data set that comes with it is also nice. My one complaint is that there are typos throughout the book, some of which caused confusion, but I was able to figure it out.

How to join tables and read the questions and how to convert them into sql queries. There are many examples and practice exercises to get a complete grip on sql commands and queries. If you are beginner in computer sciences and would like basic knowledge on databases and sql i would highly suggest buying this book. It also has complex commands and the end for creating views for your queries which are very good. It also helps you understand normalisation and how different companies use different normalisations and helps classify them so you get a good understanding on the topic.

The content of the book itself is good, except in all black and white, which doesn't bother me personally but may bother someone else when it comes to the graphs. I think the R and Python content are both great, and it keeps the code concise and quick to the point. Great for R beginners, but for python users I would recommend a little more experience. As for the math parts, its great for those who are new to statistics and gives easy to read explanations, and a great refresher for those who just want to review some of the concepts.

Or simply, I personally got bored and needed to write a bunch of memos towards the end of the book, to continue repeating what I felt I wasn't interested in, because it was easier than enough.

The author has two primary topic elements (Python and statistics) and he misses on them both.  The discussion of statistics is insufficiently supported from a mathematical perspective and the Python is little more than a shameless plug for the author's own package.  Worse still, as other reviewers have pointed out, many of the functions in his package are pointless replications of already existing statistical functions.  Moreover, the wording of his text seems almost intentionally obfuscated to avoid telling readers there are pre-existing functions in common packages such as NumPy and matplotlib which make his function irrelevant. I purchased this book as it was required for a class, but I won't even resell it used because I am morally opposed to selling anything I already know to be so completely defective there is no way it can be of any use to the buyer.

399,"DGB",3,"Extremely helpful but a bit too clever for beginners","2018-10-22","I've been working with this book for a couple of months now -- lots of tabs and highlights.  It is amazingly comprehensive for it's length but if you are pretty new to ggplot, this is a challenging introduction in the following way:  the examples start at a pretty complex level of aesthetic combos and they are a bit too clever.  As an example, things like the geom 'label' uses a dataframe named 'label' to place a label of 'label' on a plot -- cute but not helpful to the reader.  This happens too much for beginners.  It's like someone who is excellent in algebra naming all the different variables in an equation ""x"" -- they can keep track easily in their head  because they breathe algebra and it saves them the trouble of thinking up a bunch of different variable names that they don't need for clarity.  But it makes it hard going for a newbie trying to learn the pieces.  In this way and others,  many portions of the book are like a second-level of ggplot use;  it's easier to learn the basics on one of the websites or one of the other cookbooks, then come here for clever ways to combine lots of things into a couple of lines of code.  Sometimes Wickham gives the impression of wanting to teach the material but can't avoid opportunities to show some cleverness -- that's great for experienced people looking for tricks but it makes this book initially a bit frustrating at points for some users (like me).  I still use it a lot but it's not a great reference for real basics.  This is in part because the indexed refs to geoms are to an initial intro of the term but if you want to see how to use that geom beyond the single initial use, you need to read the whole book because the specifics are embedded in many other examples.  This is no doubt on purpose but, again, be aware it's not a very good reference-type book.",37

It included color illustrations of output expected and makes use of R datasets as examples so that the reader can reproduce the graphics in going through the book.

A knowledge of R at the intermediate level is assumed.",37
402,"Abacus",2,"Book is challenging, and not that helpful","2017-08-17","I found chapter 2 guiding you through the basics very good.  The remainder of the book is often challenging and cryptic.  Numerous of the codes did not work.  That was especially true for a key chapter (11 Modeling for visualization) where some codes early in the chapter did not work, and prevented me from getting any benefit from the majority of the chapter.  That was true of the codes that the author posted on the Internet too.  Also, even though the graphs are often impressive they invariably do not convey accurate confidence intervals.  Using ggplot2, specifying Confidence Intervals @95% level, you are lucky if you capture 40% of the actual observations (instead of ~ 95%).",37

As a statistics graduate student I found this book to be an excellent introduction to this R package and found the 2nd edition to be very up to date. It is by no means an exhaustive reference, but that makes the book readable and easy to follow. It provides just enough information to get you started and to point out major features and pitfalls, but there is no excess of words.

Wickham is extremely dedicated to this concept of ""grammar"" but it did not help me make plots any faster.  I usually look at my data and then ideas for plots and images of plots  start coming to me and I want to know the syntax of the language so I can start making plots.  I would not call this book a syntax reference.  I am still frustrated by R when it comes to programming plots and this book is not helping.

I struggled to implement this code style due to my ignorance on algorithms and the pandas API methods that make this happen.  This book fully pounds the table in advocating the usage of method chaining and provides full rebuttals to the numerous push backs the author has received over the countless hours of teaching pandas.  The book is heavily geared toward users using Jupyter Notebooks and not necessarily those writing / reading web services or interacting heavily with relational databases / not static data sources.  I feel like the book is very honest about the warts of Pandas (lots of gotchas, some not implemented APIs, and many bugs :)).

This book is not good for people just starting out.  Where it says ""who this book is for"" it says it can be for newer people who want to learn how to do it correctly the first time and this is not true. I have  been coding for about 6 months and completed 5 other books before this one as well as countless youtube tutorials.  The book doesn't have an answer code. There is a community answer code but only to chapter 8.  It is also hard to follow along and the exercises are not well defined.  If you are trying to read the book and do the code in the book at the same time it doesn't always match up.  For example section 9.5 it talks about interpolating data.  The code it gives below is temp = pd.Series([32, 40, None, 42, 39, 32]).  You get an error saying ""temp"" doesn't exist. So where is the the code coming from? What data is it looking at?  Its not from the car sample data in the beginning.  It never tells you or clarifies.  This happens multiple times in the book.  On the exercises it tells you ""with a dataset of your choice""  do this......  So there is no direction.

The content of the book itself is good, except in all black and white, which doesn't bother me personally but may bother someone else when it comes to the graphs. I think the R and Python content are both great, and it keeps the code concise and quick to the point. Great for R beginners, but for python users I would recommend a little more experience.

Unfortunately despite downloading the code examples and data sets as described as the book, I'm constantly assailed by would be (if I knew as much as the authors - or at least I suspect so) minor problems actually running the code.  The examples as written in the books don't always work on my machine, the examples as downloaded from their website don 't always work on my machine.

So if you are looking for a reference that covers almost everything at an applied level, this is a great one. If you are looking for more detailed understanding of any topic, then there're many other texts.

Or simply, I personally got bored and needed to write a bunch of memos towards the end of the book, to continue repeating what I felt I wasn't interested in, because it was easier than enough. Speaking of this, the pedagogy looks to me that it turns to the idea of repetition of learning along a spectrum or curve where one increments there ability to perform statistical processing of statistically calculable theoretical knowledge and significant intuitively in this respect.",32

Granted the author had stated the book should be used in tandem with sites like codeacademy; there was still an expectation to provide more standalone examples to the user to be able to read without having to access the sites ( which the lessons do not pair as well as you would expect to the chapters).  That being said I skimmed the last section regarding the cybersecurity as I work in the field and found this to be very generic in the presentation of material as well because the author only provides a small paragraph definition of a few common terms.

If Amazon allowed returns of Kindle material, I'd return this and hold out for a paper copy. No shade being cast on the authors, here. This is a DRM play, if I've ever seen one.  So do the authors a solid, and go to your local B&N and order a meat space copy of this book.

539,"DGB",3,"Extremely helpful but a bit too clever for beginners","2018-10-22","I've been working with this book for a couple of months now -- lots of tabs and highlights.  It is amazingly comprehensive for it's length but if you are pretty new to ggplot, this is a challenging introduction in the following way:  the examples start at a pretty complex level of aesthetic combos and they are a bit too clever.  As an example, things like the geom 'label' uses a dataframe named 'label' to place a label of 'label' on a plot -- cute but not helpful to the reader.  This happens too much for beginners.  It's like someone who is excellent in algebra naming all the different variables in an equation ""x"" -- they can keep track easily in their head  because they breathe algebra and it saves them the trouble of thinking up a bunch of different variable names that they don't need for clarity.  But it makes it hard going for a newbie trying to learn the pieces.  In this way and others,  many portions of the book are like a second-level of ggplot use;  it's easier to learn the basics on one of the websites or one of the other cookbooks, then come here for clever ways to combine lots of things into a couple of lines of code.  Sometimes Wickham gives the impression of wanting to teach the material but can't avoid opportunities to show some cleverness -- that's great for experienced people looking for tricks but it makes this book initially a bit frustrating at points for some users (like me).  I still use it a lot but it's not a great reference for real basics.  This is in part because the indexed refs to geoms are to an initial intro of the term but if you want to see how to use that geom beyond the single initial use, you need to read the whole book because the specifics are embedded in many other examples.  This is no doubt on purpose but, again, be aware it's not a very good reference-type book.",37
540,"Dan",5,"Up to date ggplot2!!","2016-07-16","This book 2016 version of the 2009 book and is really good. Great examples!

It included color illustrations of output expected and makes use of R datasets as examples so that the reader can reproduce the graphics in going through the book. There are exercises interspersed throughout the Chapters focusing on the ""next steps"" that a student of ggplot may want to undertake making the book a good self-learning tool.  A knowledge of R at the intermediate level is assumed.",37
542,"Abacus",2,"Book is challenging, and not that helpful","2017-08-17","I found chapter 2 guiding you through the basics very good.  The remainder of the book is often challenging and cryptic.  Numerous of the codes did not work.  That was especially true for a key chapter (11 Modeling for visualization) where some codes early in the chapter did not work, and prevented me from getting any benefit from the majority of the chapter.  That was true of the codes that the author posted on the Internet too.  Also, even though the graphs are often impressive they invariably do not convey accurate confidence intervals.  Using ggplot2, specifying Confidence Intervals @95% level, you are lucky if you capture 40% of the actual observations (instead of ~ 95%).",37

Tools like Tableau or Microsoft office can only take you so far.  ggplot is an excellent option that allows you to make highly customizable graphs at the cost of a slightly increased learning curve. As a statistics graduate student I found this book to be an excellent introduction to this R package and found the 2nd edition to be very up to date. It is by no means an exhaustive reference, but that makes the book readable and easy to follow. It provides just enough information to get you started and to point out major features and pitfalls, but there is no excess of words.  I also appreciated the writer's familiarity with Tufte's philosophy. I highly recommend this book to anyone with at least a basic familiarity with R who looking to up their visualizations skills.",37

It is a very short book with an index and r-code index that are each only about 3 pages long.  Wickham is extremely dedicated to this concept of ""grammar"" but it did not help me make plots any faster.  I usually look at my data and then ideas for plots and images of plots  start coming to me and I want to know the syntax of the language so I can start making plots.  I would not call this book a syntax reference.  I am still frustrated by R when it comes to programming plots and this book is not helping.

So if you are looking for a reference that covers almost everything at an applied level, this is a great one.

The Index is near to useless.  We get reference books like this to learn the details of code and to look up questions as we are working with the code.  This involves referring to the Index.  It seems that creating the Index was rushed - perhaps the authors created it themselves instead of having someone who knew what they were doing create it?  In any case, you find something like the word ""Select"" and then 42 (!) pages or page combinations where this word appears.  Did that help?  Not at all, unless you want to look through 42 different page references.  As a matter of fact, the entire Index is only 4 pages total which should say something in itself.  Other than this, I think the book will be helpful BUT I need a decent Index to get the most use out of it.  I will essentially have to recreate it myself so that I can find key terms when needed.",51

607,"jack wilinsky",5,"Excellent treatment of statistical calculations in R","2018-08-21","First of all, this is NOT a good book to learn R if you are a beginner. It assumes a basic knowledge of R but still goes through a lot of the basics. It does not attempt to teach a broad coverage of the language. For example, it has nothing on flow control, which makes sense since this deals with the statistical packages already in R so it doesn't cover how to actually write your own programs in R(if you want to do that, ""R For Dummies"" is an excellent introduction). So, this book sticks to what it is advertised to do: statistics. Does it cover an enormous amount of topics? No, after all, statistics is very vast. It covers such things as linear models, one and two way anova and contrasts in anova, for example. It doesn't cover topics in psychometry(which R can handle very nicely), like Cronbach's Alpha. So, this book is not encyclopedic, but you can see what it covers and what it doesn't before you buy it. No one source is going to give you everything in the R language. This book is an excellent source for what it does cover. Don't assume that just because it is part of the ""For Dummies"" series that it is super basic. There are many detailed, intricate books in the series. The series also includes many other books on R so, you might consider starting a collection!",52
608,"Leeber Cohen",4,"Not an ideal book for a beginner. Some very nice examples of graphing techniques.","2020-10-04","The book has a noble goal of teaching  statistical analysis with R programming. The book nicely demonstrates the graphing capabilities of the software. The statistics reviewed are normal distribution, basic z-tests, t-tests, , regression, and some probability. I am not sure that this is a good book for beginning reader who is learning statistics or for someone starting to learn R.  More excercises, databases, and simpler code are needed for the text to be a useful to a beginner.  I had some problems with the code as written on page 151. If I moved the geom_segment  code to right after the geom_line code I stopped getting error messages in the console. I might add be very  careful with all the + signs and their location  in the arguments for ggplot for this code sample.  If the reader selectively reads through the codes and examples there are many valuable techniques, functions, and graphing to be learned with this text.

Dr. Hatcher's writing is clear and concise, which allows for readers to grasp the information in order to synthesize it.  He doesn't 'dummy down' the intricacies of the linear model, and fully details the model's equation and its purpose.

If you're looking to learn statistics AND learn R - this is a great book for you to start with. However - I imagine the people in that subset are really, really small, since most people that know statistics will want more advanced R, and most people with no statistics knowledge would be using other software.",52

If Amazon allowed returns of Kindle material, I'd return this and hold out for a paper copy. No shade being cast on the authors, here. This is a DRM play, if I've ever seen one.  So do the authors a solid, and go to your local B&N and order a meat space copy of this book.

Took one star off due to poor Amazon services: we cannot communicate with Amazon about if they would or could provide a replacement which is NOT damaged.  the only choice is to take the risk and buy another book in order to compare the two same books to decide which one is in good condition.  Since we pay full price for new hardcopy, we expect the book to be in new and good condition.  As you can see the picture, it is not.  Again it is not the author's fault.  We don't want to return it just in case the book is sold out.  We would like to exchange it but there is no way to communicate with Amazon (does Amazon care?) to see if there is a brand new book available that is not damaged.  Sadly we are keeping this book",54

Like many, it was the first book I ever read on the craft. Toady, I really luxuriate in how much praise Tufte gave to some really old work. I found Tufte’s ability to describe what is so magical about data storytelling to be way ahead of his time, almost poetic. My favorite line is the very last one in the book, “the task of the designer is to give visual access to the subtle and the difficult—that is, the revelation of the complex.”",54

I struggled to implement this code style due to my ignorance on algorithms and the pandas API methods that make this happen.  This book fully pounds the table in advocating the usage of method chaining and provides full rebuttals to the numerous push backs the author has received over the countless hours of teaching pandas.  The book is heavily geared toward users using Jupyter Notebooks and not necessarily those writing / reading web services or interacting heavily with relational databases / not static data sources.  I feel like the book is very honest about the warts of Pandas (lots of gotchas, some not implemented APIs, and many bugs :)).  In some cases, the author references github issues referencing those, but it would have been nice to see links to all those issues mentioned by the author so to check on resolution going forward.",55

This book is not good for people just starting out.  Where it says ""who this book is for"" it says it can be for newer people who want to learn how to do it correctly the first time and this is not true. I have  been coding for about 6 months and completed 5 other books before this one as well as countless youtube tutorials.  The book doesn't have an answer code. There is a community answer code but only to chapter 8.  It is also hard to follow along and the exercises are not well defined.  If you are trying to read the book and do the code in the book at the same time it doesn't always match up.  For example section 9.5 it talks about interpolating data.  The code it gives below is temp = pd.Series([32, 40, None, 42, 39, 32]).  You get an error saying ""temp"" doesn't exist. So where is the the code coming from? What data is it looking at?  Its not from the car sample data in the beginning.  It never tells you or clarifies.  This happens multiple times in the book.  On the exercises it tells you ""with a dataset of your choice""  do this......  So there is no direction.  I also tried to find community groups to work with to answer questions and I didn't find anything.",55

The code examples, especially the later ones, are very hard to recreate, in part due to the fast moving release cycle of Spark, but also, due to the fact that unless you are in a big shop with lots of servers, it's going to be hard to recreate the conditions. Most importantly, however is that the examples are not self-contained and leave the reader having to infer what some of the variables are (say, from previous examples, continued implicitly).

For instance, the scala shell of the latest version 1.6.1 doesn't load cleanly (it gives a long list of stack back trace exceptions) and the one in the book 1.3.0 is dated by more than a year. But, ok, I went with 1.3.0 and found the instruction on p. 12 fails to suppress the annoying diagnostics. Example 2-11 fails because saveAsTextFile fails with a null pointer exception. I skipped ahead and found snippets in Scala, Java, and Python which the authors show what ""should"" work in theory except there's no way to really test the code because it is written in isolation from prior code. In other words, the book is not a tutorial. Instead, it emphasizes the speed of spark but I couldn't get it to run reliably, if at all, with simple instructions and toy examples on a single-node environment. What can one expect in more complex, production scenarios? I have to wonder if all the hadoop talk and big data are the latest IT hype.

I am a fairly advanced Excel user but had not done much with Python beyond getting the Python interpreter to print “Hello World!”. What I didn’t understand was how to use Python to accomplish practical things, like open a folder, write to a file, or collect information from the web. This book fixed that by showing me how I could add an extra brain and tools (Python) to a user interface (Excel) that I was familiar with. I am most excited about “User Defined Functions”. These are functions like SUM or AVERAGE that come standard with Excel, but which you can write yourself in Python – hence “user defined”. If you don’t know how to write Python code, don’t worry. Someone has probably written code that accomplishes what you want to accomplish, and you’ll probably find it with a Google search. You can copy the code and plug it into your own code, and you will learn Python by modifying the code slightly to accomplish what you want to accomplish.

The code examples, especially the later ones, are very hard to recreate, in part due to the fast moving release cycle of Spark, but also, due to the fact that unless you are in a big shop with lots of servers, it's going to be hard to recreate the conditions. Most importantly, however is that the examples are not self-contained and leave the reader having to infer what some of the variables are (say, from previous examples, continued implicitly). Maybe they did this for space considerations as the book is modest in size at 240 pages.",59

For instance, the scala shell of the latest version 1.6.1 doesn't load cleanly (it gives a long list of stack back trace exceptions) and the one in the book 1.3.0 is dated by more than a year. But, ok, I went with 1.3.0 and found the instruction on p. 12 fails to suppress the annoying diagnostics. Example 2-11 fails because saveAsTextFile fails with a null pointer exception. I skipped ahead and found snippets in Scala, Java, and Python which the authors show what ""should"" work in theory except there's no way to really test the code because it is written in isolation from prior code. In other words, the book is not a tutorial. Instead, it emphasizes the speed of spark but I couldn't get it to run reliably, if at all, with simple instructions and toy examples on a single-node environment. What can one expect in more complex, production scenarios? I have to wonder if all the hadoop talk and big data are the latest IT hype.

938,"Cesar A. Brea",5,"A healthy blend of competence and humility","2014-10-13","I make my living working with businesses to help them build their analytic capabilities in sales and marketing, by working on real opportunities and generalizing lessons from specific experiences and results.  Business sort of demands that over time you narrow problem-defining frameworks, problem-solving techniques, and problem-processing operations to what you can scale and consistently deliver.  But what I have learned is that if you push these past use as points of departure, and force them as points of arrival, results and learning suffer.  (As they say, if you have a hammer, then everything looks like, etc. etc.) This is especially true as things get more complex on all these fronts.  What I appreciated about this book was that even as it is an excellent survey of specific approaches and techniques at the coal-face of their application (there are code samples here, people!), it's also a thoughtful exposition of the limits of these and of the pitfalls they present.  You might be tempted to skip Chapters 15 and 16 if you're just looking to RTFM, but you shouldn't; for me they were the real meat of the book. Maybe it's confirmation bias at work, but it was reassuring to hear such a humble tone coming at the end of such a competent treatment of different data science challenges.  Doing this work very occasionally brings triumph and much more often despair, so it helps to have reminders from seasoned pros that what really matters is just trying, steadily, to get better at your craft.",70

What I mean by that is this book is not written as a textbook, but rather, as suggested by the title, as a guide to the actual reality of the occupation. Different chapters are based on lectures given by different practitioners in the field, and so the book as a whole gives an excellent holistic perspective on the profession. It took some getting used to, as I did expect more of an academic, textbook treatment---and to be fair, there is quite a bit of statistics and data wrangling in the book. But given that data science is not really a subject, but a job title (one can see this in the history of the term), the book's approach makes total sense. As a handbook for the profession, I found the book to be clear, substantive, and astonishingly thoughtful, particularly in regards to the ethical dimensions of the job.

The book is a great overview of the general field of analyzing large datasets and building models. It strikes just the right balance between mathematical rigor and approachability. Specifically, every concept that is introduced is always accompanied by a real example involving real data, so its great to see what a particular method does to a set of numbers which, in my mind, is the clearest way to understand what an algorithm is actually doing. This book also served for me as a quick primer to R, as long as you are familiar with some other package for data handling & modeling (e.g. spss or matlab) the book got me comfortable with R very quickly.

The real benefit of this book is that the authors try to provide thought leadership to architects who have to make decisions found in this book.

My SQL querying skill prior to purchasing this book was, at best,  intermediate. I also was not familiar with some newer SQL Server functions (e.g. CTE, Windows functions), having not used the SQL language for several years. As a result, I was forced to perform a bit of on-line research to solve the problems. That was OK; Google is your friend. To benefit from this book, effort is definitely required. It is not a SQL manual that one occasionally references for syntax or examples. Rather, it is the closest substitute for taking a SQL querying class. I learned quite a bit. Repetition is the key. One can know SQL syntax, but still not know how to methodically approach and resolve a problem. I felt this book enhanced my skill in answering various types of real world data questions by forcing me to think rather than feeding me the solutions.

1014,"Matias",5,"Great reminder of basic math","2023-04-28","This book is a great primer/reminder of basic math. But not only that. It also explores ways of thinking like a mathematician- things one didn’t necessarily learn in school but are more useful to everyday life than knowing the Pythagorean theorem. I liked the author’s structuring and found his writing witty and enjoyable. It’s odd to say that a book about math was a page turner, yet I must say it.",68

1016,"William P Ross",5,"Excellent Learning Resource For R And Statistics","2016-12-16","R in Action does an excellent job showing the power of the R language. The book also serves a way to learn statistics and data science through using the R language.",73
1017,"Ravindra Arya",5,"Required reading for R users!","2017-11-22","I have read quite a few books on R, and will rate this as perhaps one of the best if not the best. The author has explained the material with excellent clarity, the examples are relevant to real-world applications, and the code executes well using either base installation of R (with added packages) or R studio. Also, the author has managed to concurrently develop both data analysis and data visualization (graphing), which helps the reader, and exposes the capabilities of R very well. The range of topics covered in this book is very broad and gives a good overview of the field. As a clinician with interest in epidemiology, I found almost everything needed for beginner or intermediate level applications. Also, if one works through this book diligently, s/he will be in a very good position to follow more advanced topics (like multilevel models) from other resources.",73
1018,"Jennifer Ann",5,"This is my R manual!","2017-11-05","This is the first product review I have ever written.  I wanted to share how wonderful this book is.  I have glanced through about 20 R books searching for the right one to have as the manual that you don't get with R.  I chose correctly this time (after making a mistake first).  ""R in Action"" is thorough, clearly written, written in a logical order, it gives examples for everything, and it even gives 3 ways to do the same thing if applicable.  As a beginning data scientist, I know that this book will be sitting on my desk and have many tabs in it to mark the places where I don't quite have the material memorized.  AND when you purchase the print version of the book, you get an ebook for free, which is so helpful since this is a programming book.  Thank you very much Robert Kabacoff for sharing your expertise with us!!!",73

1020,"MJ",5,"Great reference for academics learning R","2017-12-31","Overall quite a fan and recommend the book! I am a graduate student who was struggling with some analyses, and this provided a great overview on the code + logic behind the analyses in a way that helped me get what I needed to do done quickly (quicker than looking up internet sources). Seems like it's going to be a great reference to have on hand at all times when putting R into practice with research. The one thing (thus far) I am disappointed with is that the code for graphs isn't complete -- frequently will say that the following code produces graph #xyz. However, the code really only produces the most basic version of the graph in the book, and they don't include the extra code for ACTUALLY reproducing (which would be handy if new to graphs and trying to figure out some basic formatting manipulations without a lot of work)",73
1021,"Jason Flaugh",5,"A great book for learning R, how to analyze data, and being used as a reference book","2016-07-12","There are far too many good things to say about this book and the author. It offers a good balance for those wishing to refresh their knowledge on R to more advance users wishing to pick up a few new tricks. Some of the concepts covered may not have been addressed in enough detail for those not experienced with R, but there are countless other supplemental sources that can be used along with this book. The author does a great job explaining statistical concepts. I would recommend this book to practitioners and teachers alike for that reason. Those focusing on statistical analysis (statistics) or data mining would enjoy this book. It doesn't cover more advance concepts in-depth like some books I have read, but that isn't this book's goal. If you want to learn more about machine learning, structural equation modeling, or more advanced analyses like neural network analysis, then you should find a book that specializes in those areas.",73

The book also includes helpful final chapters on the ethics of research, formulation of writing assignments for teachers, and an appendix of research tools for both off- and online. The book’s section on making an argument strong is especially helpful in an age of speciously argued claims. As the authors say in the first chapter, “Why should I adopt language and forms that are not mine? Aren’t you just trying to turn me into an academic like yourself? If I write as you expect me to, I risk losing my identity. Such concerns are legitimate (most teachers wish students would raise them more often). But it would be a feeble education that did not change you at all, and the deeper your education, the more it will change the ‘you’ that you are or want to be. That’s why it’s so important to choose carefully what you study and with whom. But it would be a mistake to think that learning to report sound research must threaten your true identity. It will change the way you think, but only by giving you more ways of thinking.” Careful attention to both the how and why of objective research-based writing is a sorely needed skill in our post-information age.

I think the book is especially oriented toward giving people interested in ""specializing"" in this field or utilizing data science some good, basic information.  As a multidisciplinary field, and one oriented toward business, government and surveillance interests, generally, it is a field that encompasses and extends into practical areas that its associated traditional area, namely statistics, has not in the past much-addressed.  Data science is an extremely interesting, technical field with broad social and ethical implications explored in this book.  Statistics is only one tool.  The authors lucidly discuss the focus on the huge amounts of valuable, unstructured data.  They point out that to make all of this useful for the goals and purposes of business, surveillance, medicine, government, etc. requires an enormous time investment in putting appropriate data together and extracting information in a usable form.  The discussion of mathematical modeling, machine learning, and the overall use of algorithms is very insightful.  The authors make it clear that data science is not merely ""deep learning"", despite the fact that the extraordinary advances in using neural nets represented by deep learning is largely responsible for much of the importance of data science today.  There are excellent perspectives of data science available on the Internet, but I think the authors of this book have provided a good supplement for this information in a deeper way.  One of the real problems in picking information out from the Internet is escaping  the ""hype"" surrounding a subject that is currently ""hot"" like data science.  This book definitely allows the interested person to separate some of the solid pieces of knowledge about what the field involves from the huge amount of ""noise"" surrounding the entire area of ""weak"" AI and machine learning.  I would recommend this book strongly to anyone seriously considering going into this field.  A point the authors stress is that weak AI, namely specialized applications, rather than broadly ""intelligent"" systems competitive with general human intelligence, has opened up a world of opportunity, promise, progress, as well as ethical dilemmas.  I personally think that data science is a great field for an enormous spectrum of technicians at all educational levels.  The book opens a window a bit on the enormous implications for our future.  It is a good start on the climb to a satisfactory knowledge of this field and its potential.  I especially recommend the book to business executives and entrepreneurs as a useful and insightful view, for developing a strategic picture of this field, that does not get into unnecessarily technical details, and is not subject to the ""hype"" and ""noise"" from the Internet.",76

I spent a good deal of time looking for free content  of which some examples were really good and others, not so much.  In particular, I struggled with VolumeClaims and PersistentVolumeClaims.

But I always felt those resources are either out dated or consist of tiny pieces here and there. The learning curve of kubernetes comes from 1. the fast changing development, new features, etc  2. lack of guides that help dive from the surface to the depth. This book solved that problem by giving you a very good example through out the book: from the most basics you need to get something up and running, to all the aspects that you will have the consider in production. And finally, the book also spend a whole chapter to bring you back to the big picture, help you refresh your memory on all the stuffs you learned and put everything together.  I like the writing style, and it is the best way to learn kubernetes or anything that's fast moving.  Thanks Marko, for bringing such an amazing book to us!",77
1099,"Zach Loeber",5,"The K8S Book to own","2019-02-03","Kubernetes books aren't all that common right now but I'd say this one is likely the most comprehensive of the lot. The inside cover contains what's covered in the book. This is very thoughtfully done in a manner that reduces the complexity of this beast to the following groups: Namespace, Workload Deployment, Services, Config, Storage. The author goes out of the way to include practical examples and sound reasons for the various component logic choices taken by Google engineers when designing Kubernetes. The book tends to reference the google cloud platform exclusively. But k8s is cloud agnostic (generally) so that should have zero bearing on your choice to own this book. There are also a broad range of other products/project/tools within this evolving ecosystem that really makes this work stand out.",77

The book is well organized and easy to follow. The author seems to realize that readers aren't going to remember everything, and frequently says things like ""(remember? you did this in Chapter 4)"", so you know where to look for a quick refresher. Overall, this book stands out as a 5 star from Manning. (I also appreciate that the author started by suggesting using minikube to follow along, used ""real"" examples on running clusters, but remembered to continuously explain what to expect on minikube (different behaviors)).",77

I think that some material could have been reduced and presented more tightly. There were a few times when I thought: just get to the point. The real benefit of this book is that the authors try to provide thought leadership to architects who have to make decisions found in this book.

The authors carefully worked out every single paragraph to make it clear and easy to understand. The writing style and real world examples make the book very easy to read (well, maybe except the section about Data Mesh, which seems too abstract to me).

Also, the author has managed to concurrently develop both data analysis and data visualization (graphing), which helps the reader, and exposes the capabilities of R very well. The range of topics covered in this book is very broad and gives a good overview of the field. As a clinician with interest in epidemiology, I found almost everything needed for beginner or intermediate level applications.

""R in Action"" is thorough, clearly written, written in a logical order, it gives examples for everything, and it even gives 3 ways to do the same thing if applicable.

I am a graduate student who was struggling with some analyses, and this provided a great overview on the code + logic behind the analyses in a way that helped me get what I needed to do done quickly (quicker than looking up internet sources). Seems like it's going to be a great reference to have on hand at all times when putting R into practice with research. The one thing (thus far) I am disappointed with is that the code for graphs isn't complete -- frequently will say that the following code produces graph #xyz. However, the code really only produces the most basic version of the graph in the book, and they don't include the extra code for ACTUALLY reproducing (which would be handy if new to graphs and trying to figure out some basic formatting manipulations without a lot of work)",73

Some of the concepts covered may not have been addressed in enough detail for those not experienced with R, but there are countless other supplemental sources that can be used along with this book. The author does a great job explaining statistical concepts. I would recommend this book to practitioners and teachers alike for that reason. Those focusing on statistical analysis (statistics) or data mining would enjoy this book. It doesn't cover more advance concepts in-depth like some books I have read, but that isn't this book's goal.

1174,"Igo Hummaan",3,"Raises More Questions than it Answers","2023-10-06","Coming from MIT Press, I expected a deeper discussion on the salient points surrounding AI and the ethical concerns that we should all be talking about. However the book takes a more abstract approach to the discussion, raising some important questions but not always answering them in a detailed way. It almost feels like a college lecture where the professor (author) prods his students (readers) to start thinking about certain issues, putting points up for debate, but never really engaging. In short, important topics are covered but not in the sort of depth one might expect. Though short, the best chapter was probably the last one, where the author draws parallels to the climate change challenge and asks some important questions about whether AI will be more of a help than a problem in mitigating climate effects. Overall not bad but there are probably better options out there.",82

ChatGPT can already write a better review of this book than most of us who make such attempts.

There are wide ranging discussions about competing lists of principles for AI ethics, worries over the potential harms of ethics washing in the AI industry, and seemingly endless quibbling about the details of what philosophers call the trolley problem.

Anyone who enjoys the combination of technology/innovation/science and rich storytelling is sure to thrilled, but what really set this book apart from its peers is the incredible perspective and thoughtfulness Ainissa injects into each story. Most science history books I've read simply focus on the lone genius and his or her overly romanticized journey to the top of their respective fields. Ainissa doesn't shy away from the darker details of these characters and stories and her writing often forced me to stop for a moment and really reconsider some deeply held beliefs I had about everyday technologies (her chapters on photography and artificial light were particularly inspiring). My *only* critique is that I wish the photos and images pertaining to the different stories in the book were placed in line with those stories (instead of grouped together in the middle of the book) but I won't even let that knock a star off what I think is a truly perfect addition to my favorite genre.",84

From the impassioned, personal opening, decrying the dulling of science that has unfortunately taken the bright curiosity of youth and crushed it with maths and tedium, to the brilliant looks at the important connections the elements on the periodic table have to us and the sometimes forgotten people who brought them to society, this book is invaluable in the way it highlights the human elements behind the atomic ones. Even more importantly, Ms. Ramirez brings to light the impact people of color have had on these important societal discoveries and transformations; she excels at making long-lost stories and amazing people known again, having been swept under the rug of misogyny and whitewashing that has plagued science throughout the 19th and 20th Centuries. Whether you are a research scientist, a casual reader, a student, an educator, or someone who longs for fresh perspective on the sciences, this book will shine for you!",84

I bought it for the scientific content and stayed to enjoy the history!  I liked the exhaustive number of pictures that were provided to give good visuals and I like the inclusion of some of the author's personal experiences within the narrative while also not letting that aspect dominate the book.  I had heard some of the stories mentioned, but not with the context that Ramirez provides so it gave me some new insights that I had not read in other books by Simon Winchester, Sam Kean or others.

It also sparked curiosity in me, and I’ve found myself looking at the world in a new way, and wondering what materials an object is made of, and how it was created.

It reminds me of James Burkes series ""Connections"" and his book ""Connections - An Alternative History of Technology"", and I'd say that it is a very worthy companion of that work.

I found myself rewriting out some of the prior chapters info as new concepts were added. This is not the kind of book you want to read without working some of the math along the way.

Before reading this book, I had a hard time differentiating priors from likelihood/data.  I always thought that the data from observations, quasi-experiments and simulation was all I had in working with the numbers; it never occurred to me that bringing in seasoned or experienced judgment through priors could formally and mathematically improve the probability of whatever I was estimating.  Now, I understand why the frequentist and the Bayesian views clash.  It was illuminating to have the tools to counter observations and data when you have other evidence to help in calibrating the final probability or posterior.  Kudos to Will Kurt.",85

1237,"Zach Loeber",5,"The K8S Book to own","2019-02-03","Kubernetes books aren't all that common right now but I'd say this one is likely the most comprehensive of the lot. The inside cover contains what's covered in the book. This is very thoughtfully done in a manner that reduces the complexity of this beast to the following groups: Namespace, Workload Deployment, Services, Config, Storage. The author goes out of the way to include practical examples and sound reasons for the various component logic choices taken by Google engineers when designing Kubernetes. The book tends to reference the google cloud platform exclusively. But k8s is cloud agnostic (generally) so that should have zero bearing on your choice to own this book. There are also a broad range of other products/project/tools within this evolving ecosystem that really makes this work stand out.",77

Anyone who enjoys the combination of technology/innovation/science and rich storytelling is sure to thrilled, but what really set this book apart from its peers is the incredible perspective and thoughtfulness Ainissa injects into each story. Most science history books I've read simply focus on the lone genius and his or her overly romanticized journey to the top of their respective fields. Ainissa doesn't shy away from the darker details of these characters and stories and her writing often forced me to stop for a moment and really reconsider some deeply held beliefs I had about everyday technologies (her chapters on photography and artificial light were particularly inspiring). My *only* critique is that I wish the photos and images pertaining to the different stories in the book were placed in line with those stories (instead of grouped together in the middle of the book) but I won't even let that knock a star off what I think is a truly perfect addition to my favorite genre.",84

From the impassioned, personal opening, decrying the dulling of science that has unfortunately taken the bright curiosity of youth and crushed it with maths and tedium, to the brilliant looks at the important connections the elements on the periodic table have to us and the sometimes forgotten people who brought them to society, this book is invaluable in the way it highlights the human elements behind the atomic ones. Even more importantly, Ms. Ramirez brings to light the impact people of color have had on these important societal discoveries and transformations; she excels at making long-lost stories and amazing people known again, having been swept under the rug of misogyny and whitewashing that has plagued science throughout the 19th and 20th Centuries. Whether you are a research scientist, a casual reader, a student, an educator, or someone who longs for fresh perspective on the sciences, this book will shine for you!",84

I bought it for the scientific content and stayed to enjoy the history!  I liked the exhaustive number of pictures that were provided to give good visuals and I like the inclusion of some of the author's personal experiences within the narrative while also not letting that aspect dominate the book.

Bingo. Found this book and have read about half of it twice. (Life is very busy for me and my reading gets been interrupted). That said, the content is so good, I find myself being a slow reader as it is chock-full of great information and insights only obtainable through a group of individuals who have walk the path of leading hundreds of these types of workshops.

It allowed me to go home and apply what I learned that weekend in a mindful and deliberate way.  The content of that workshop was exactly what I needed to design a workshop that connects my content with my participants in way that creates lasting transformation.  EVERYTHING in the manual was clear and rich with tons of ideas that I used in my workshops. I was therefore beyond thrilled when I learned that this ""Workshop DREAM TEAM"" had published a book based on the workshops and that incredible manual.

I found myself rewriting out some of the prior chapters info as new concepts were added. This is not the kind of book you want to read without working some of the math along the way.

I always thought that the data from observations, quasi-experiments and simulation was all I had in working with the numbers; it never occurred to me that bringing in seasoned or experienced judgment through priors could formally and mathematically improve the probability of whatever I was estimating.  Now, I understand why the frequentist and the Bayesian views clash.  It was illuminating to have the tools to counter observations and data when you have other evidence to help in calibrating the final probability or posterior.  Kudos to Will Kurt.",85

While ML deployment needs for individual business use cases are highly specific, I find the overview deployment framework provided by the book to be helpful. I also liked that the book uses screenshots of Spark UI and arrows to point in the screenshots to explain the UI, since the UI can be hard to understand. The code samples and the graphics in other sections are useful as well. There’s also coverage on how to connect to different apps, like beeline (which I’ve never heard of), tableau, thrift.

After all, the first edition makes use of Apache Spark 1.3.0, whereas this update makes use of Apache Spark 3.0.0-preview2 (the latest version available at the time of writing). For the most part, I successfully ran all notebook code out of the box using Databricks Runtime 7.6 ML (includes Apache Spark 3.0.1, Scala 2.12), albeit minor issues are explained later in this review alongside my resolutions to these. I was, however, able to successfully run all standalone PySpark applications from chapters #2 and #3 out of the box using Apache Spark 3.0.1 and Python 3.7.9. As explained, the approach used here is intended to be conductive to hands-on learning, but with a focus on Spark's Structured APIs, so there are a few topics that aren't covered, such as the following: the older low-level Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) APIs, GraphX (Spark's API for graphs and graph-parallel computation), how to extend Spark's Catalyst optimizer, how to implement your own catalog, and how to write your own DataSource V2 data sinks and sources.",95

1473,"Karth Antony",5,"Excellent concept","2022-04-21","Well written book detailing the importance of trading multiple non-correlated systems simultaneously to produce higher CAGR but with lower volatility and a better MAR. The strategies in the book have been rigorously backtested and the contribution of each system to the whole multi-system approach is evident when they are backtested together. The strategies themselves are complex and not easy to execute in a standard platform but requires highly complex software to backtest and generate orders. However if such a software can be used to implement these strategies the results will be satisfactory. The importance of risk tolerance and position sizing is also emphasized. Using margin with negatively correlating strategies is also safer and likely to improve returns while lowering volatility. Overall an excellent book even if the practical applications could be a bit challenging to execute.",89

I rate this book slightly above average because as claimed by the book, it is just what I needed to prepare for my interviews - the book is more of a series of lecture notes from a class on Data Structures and Algorithms with a variety of problems. On the positive side, the book focuses on conveying the most essential aspects of each topic followed by problems of increasing difficulty. The solutions are often supported by full Python code. However, there are a number of grammatical errors, as well as a few bugs in the code. And, let me mention that I have not been very thorough during my preparation; so I bet one would spot even more errors. My suggestion to the authors would be to review and rectify the errors first, next improve on the exposition and only then publish the next version/reprint. As time permits, I would be happy to add to the book's errata to bring to your attention the aforementioned errors. Moreover, I felt the book is a little bulky to carry. It would be more convenient if it could be reduced to 3/4th its current size even if it calls for adding more pages; and I think the figures, codes and the surrounding space can be used more effectively for the contextual text to aid in reducing the overall book size.",97

Chapter 6 is very relevant, if you are a scala dev you can get into the weeds there. There's even a chapter dedicated to Delta lake which I think is a must read. The MLlib/ Mlflow chapters are pretty much for the novice, so it's a good segue for the data engineer to get a gentle intro to ML. Overall I highly recommend the book.",95

They just sent you to the Documentation! Some notebooks for the book hosted on GitHub, if you import them to Databricks account, cannot even align with the examples in the book. In summary, the title of this book is indeed misleading, not friendly to beginner at all. Much lower quality than Learning SQL 2ed.

For instance, I would usually just define an __str__ method on my custom classes and be lazy and not implement __repr__. But the book points out that if you want be lazy, just define __repr__ alone, as the default behavior of __str__ will call your __repr__ function anyway.

I have always been amazed by students or colleagues who seem to have this uncanny ability to ""master"" a language like Python.  I have purchased many Python books over the years but none of them really felt like the fit.  This one does.  I feel this book will take from up from beginning (functions, for loops, arrays, conditionals) to a more advanced programming using programming constructs beyond the basics.

While ML deployment needs for individual business use cases are highly specific, I find the overview deployment framework provided by the book to be helpful. I also liked that the book uses screenshots of Spark UI and arrows to point in the screenshots to explain the UI, since the UI can be hard to understand. The code samples and the graphics in other sections are useful as well. There’s also coverage on how to connect to different apps, like beeline (which I’ve never heard of), tableau, thrift.

After all, the first edition makes use of Apache Spark 1.3.0, whereas this update makes use of Apache Spark 3.0.0-preview2 (the latest version available at the time of writing). For the most part, I successfully ran all notebook code out of the box using Databricks Runtime 7.6 ML (includes Apache Spark 3.0.1, Scala 2.12), albeit minor issues are explained later in this review alongside my resolutions to these. I was, however, able to successfully run all standalone PySpark applications from chapters #2 and #3 out of the box using Apache Spark 3.0.1 and Python 3.7.9. As explained, the approach used here is intended to be conductive to hands-on learning, but with a focus on Spark's Structured APIs, so there are a few topics that aren't covered, such as the following: the older low-level Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) APIs, GraphX (Spark's API for graphs and graph-parallel computation), how to extend Spark's Catalyst optimizer, how to implement your own catalog, and how to write your own DataSource V2 data sinks and sources.",95

If Amazon allowed returns of Kindle material, I'd return this and hold out for a paper copy. No shade being cast on the authors, here. This is a DRM play, if I've ever seen one.  So do the authors a solid, and go to your local B&N and order a meat space copy of this book.

1654,"Jon",5,"A Great Read","2019-05-22","Dan breaks down some fascinating yet semi-complex features of Python like iterators/iterables, first class functions, scope, generators, and decorators. 30-45 min sections make the chapters an easy daily read. What is different about Dan is his self-awareness of community and his passion to share his love of Python in a remarkably upbeat and positive way.  He works to inform, encourage and tear down barriers like tossing the overly self-consciousness of one's work for the 'stick your neck out' mentality.  He provides sage advice and actively works to build quality materials. Recommendations of further reading are provided. I particularly enjoy the realpython.org site too!

I rate this book slightly above average because as claimed by the book, it is just what I needed to prepare for my interviews - the book is more of a series of lecture notes from a class on Data Structures and Algorithms with a variety of problems. On the positive side, the book focuses on conveying the most essential aspects of each topic followed by problems of increasing difficulty. The solutions are often supported by full Python code. However, there are a number of grammatical errors, as well as a few bugs in the code. And, let me mention that I have not been very thorough during my preparation; so I bet one would spot even more errors. My suggestion to the authors would be to review and rectify the errors first, next improve on the exposition and only then publish the next version/reprint. As time permits, I would be happy to add to the book's errata to bring to your attention the aforementioned errors. Moreover, I felt the book is a little bulky to carry. It would be more convenient if it could be reduced to 3/4th its current size even if it calls for adding more pages; and I think the figures, codes and the surrounding space can be used more effectively for the contextual text to aid in reducing the overall book size.",97

The book covers a lot of subjects but there is a good flow of information.  There are parts of the information that repeat somewhat in sections that deal with closely related subjects.  This seems primarily due to the fact that the author wrote it with both reading and referencing in mind.

My SQL querying skill prior to purchasing this book was, at best,  intermediate. I also was not familiar with some newer SQL Server functions (e.g. CTE, Windows functions), having not used the SQL language for several years. As a result, I was forced to perform a bit of on-line research to solve the problems. That was OK; Google is your friend. To benefit from this book, effort is definitely required. It is not a SQL manual that one occasionally references for syntax or examples. Rather, it is the closest substitute for taking a SQL querying class. I learned quite a bit. Repetition is the key. One can know SQL syntax, but still not know how to methodically approach and resolve a problem. I felt this book enhanced my skill in answering various types of real world data questions by forcing me to think rather than feeding me the solutions. I recommend this book to anyone who is willing to expend effort toward enhancing their  SQL querying aptitude. It is a valuable tool and I thank Ms. Vasilik for publishing it.",113

But the book points out that if you want be lazy, just define __repr__ alone, as the default behavior of __str__ will call your __repr__ function anyway.

The strategies in the book have been rigorously backtested and the contribution of each system to the whole multi-system approach is evident when they are backtested together. The strategies themselves are complex and not easy to execute in a standard platform but requires highly complex software to backtest and generate orders. However if such a software can be used to implement these strategies the results will be satisfactory. The importance of risk tolerance and position sizing is also emphasized. Using margin with negatively correlating strategies is also safer and likely to improve returns while lowering volatility.

However the book takes a more abstract approach to the discussion, raising some important questions but not always answering them in a detailed way. It almost feels like a college lecture where the professor (author) prods his students (readers) to start thinking about certain issues, putting points up for debate, but never really engaging. In short, important topics are covered but not in the sort of depth one might expect. Though short, the best chapter was probably the last one, where the author draws parallels to the climate change challenge and asks some important questions about whether AI will be more of a help than a problem in mitigating climate effects.

The book’s section on making an argument strong is especially helpful in an age of speciously argued claims. As the authors say in the first chapter, “Why should I adopt language and forms that are not mine? Aren’t you just trying to turn me into an academic like yourself? If I write as you expect me to, I risk losing my identity. Such concerns are legitimate (most teachers wish students would raise them more often). But it would be a feeble education that did not change you at all, and the deeper your education, the more it will change the ‘you’ that you are or want to be. That’s why it’s so important to choose carefully what you study and with whom. But it would be a mistake to think that learning to report sound research must threaten your true identity. It will change the way you think, but only by giving you more ways of thinking.” Careful attention to both the how and why of objective research-based writing is a sorely needed skill in our post-information age.

I teach an undergraduate Business Statistics course and an Introductory Management Science course at a State University Business College, but I do not teach Excel per se.  My focus is on the basic mathematics of these subjects, a better understanding as to where the numbers come from and what they mean.  Dr. Winston has managed to combine the instruction on how to use Excel with able instruction on the math behind the models and the formulas.

It may well be, come to think of it, they originally weren't, and so the best explanation for this mess was a rush to publish and/or a lack of conscientious editorial staff.

I don't have files big or varied enough to practice, so it puts me in a bit of a bind. Maybe if I ever find myself needing to do any of these advanced techniques for work I will be able to use this book to help, but it would be much better if I had time to practice BEFORE I need these skills for work.

His explanations are clear, his examples are to the point, and throughout it all, he is results-oriented. That is an important distinction; if you want theory, if you want to follow the development of algorithms, then attend a lecture by Moses Charikar (actually everyone should attend a Charikar lecture, just for the utter joy of the intellectual insights.) If you want a hands-on, practical guide to the processes involved in Data Science, then Foreman is your guy. Unlike many writers in the field, he is not an ""every problem is a nail"" guru, touting one magic approach to all problems.

Whether your planning to perform data mining work yourself or you just want to really understand what it's all about, you won't be disappointed.  There are some additional topics that I had wished were included in more detail but I've discovered that this is because this is still a young discipline and those things (e.g., formal detailed methodologies) just don't exist yet.

The book requires  a background in a number of  supportive academics for full understanding . The discipline has defined its own language much like most of the technolgical disciplines and is best appreciated by those familiar with the vocabulary.

I found this book to be highly useful to transition to thinking in terms of big data and to get out of the thinking of count-and-sort, which is so prevalent in heuristic modeling.  I've spent most of my time in the clustering and network graph theory chapters.  The sample data provided for Excel is useful to start with.  I got right into R, and it was fun to see it all come together in both Excel and R.  I will point out that the R chapter does not give sample code for network graphs - when you get there, look into Newman's fgreedy as a quick way to get up and running with modularity optimization.

Numerical analysis to me is the perfect combination: it has both mathematics and programming.  A good example of this idea is Numerical Recipes in C, where you have both algorithms and their implementation.  That being said, this book delivers where Numerical Recipes misses.  It provides insight and understanding and explains the algorithms, not in a cookbook fashion, rather in a linear progressive method.  There's not a single piece of code yet the algorithms are clearly expressed.  It provides a clear understanding of methods I've used but didn't truly understand.  It adds by discussing topics that aren't usually discussed in regular Numerical analysis textbooks, such as universal matrices, Stirling numbers, and Bernoulli numbers, generating functions, Riemann zeta function, Hermite interpolation, Chebyshev approximation, Adams-Bashforth and Milne methods and much, much more.",150

Most statistics curriculums focus on calculations  and cramming a bunch of concepts down a student’s throat. While that’s fine and all, I’ve always strived to drive home the point of “why and HOW could I use this in a practical sense, and what am I being taught that’s truly practical in most situations?” This book covers just that…it’s no lie that most students will move on from statistics and forget most things, but the conceptual parts of this book are what make statistics more memorable and could be great points to bring up in a statistics course to make students better and more informed consumers of statistics (and will hopefully better prepare those who are going to go to grad school, as I suffered the fate of not having a good stats background in my undergrad years).

Also, often when we encounter something that seems complex, we take it for granted that the phenomenon must be the result of an underlying mechanism that is itself complex. The author shows us how simple programs can, in fact, produce great complexity. In regards to physics, the author states, “that thinking in terms of simple programs will make it possible to construct a single truly fundamental theory of physics, from which space, time, quantum mechanics and all the other known feature of our universe will emerge.” We learn in this book, through virtually hundreds of pages of diagrams, how simple initial conditions can produce complex behavior.

Newton's laws. Maxwell's equations. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Things behaved in a certain way because the law was embedded into them. This point of view is the expression of Christian reductionism (In the beginning was the word.....), that within the seemingly sinful random behavior of real things, that there was an expression of some deeper reality. If the hybridization of red and white sweet peas didn't result in 25% of their offspring being red, but rather 23% or 28%, it didn't matter - the principle of an autosomal recessive trait was the same, and the genetic truth was in itself unchanging. Wolfram turns science on its ear by demonstrating how reality is in some way an expression of the chaos embedded in all behaviors. Perturb some supersymmetry, and all reality is generated. The behavior of nuclei and stars, the leaf of a maple tree, the behavior of socieites. Tweak the void with a tiny change, and like a dinner-bell, voila! all reality is served up. This book is not for the faint of heart, but just about every page is provocative. One will find much to consider, and, like the good meal alluded above, digestion will take far longer than the eating.  A tour of Wolfram's software child, Mathematica may help this sometimes baffling reexpression of all science, but is not necessary. Like listening to Beethoven, in which a degree in music appreciation is unnecessary but helpful, formal mathematics opens the door of Wolfram's work a reality unavailable without it, but is in no way necessary to see the beauty of his approach. In the end, the effort of reading it is well worth it, and the hyperbole ""Life changing"" may not be out of order.",159

The book has a practical focus and is intended as a primer and recipe book. This is not the place to go for in-depth theoretical discussions. Also, some of the author's recipes are based on unorthodox viewpoints (e.g his preference for RPC over REST). Justifications are provided, but are not argued at length. I found this refreshing, others may find it maddening. Generally, the recipes are smart, actionable, widely applicable and clearly explained. However, the book is overpriced. Although there is a lot of content packed into this small package, the author ends the book by listing additional topics to be covered in future volumes.

For example, in the Zero Risk Chapter, loss aversion and risk are not the same concept but were discussed as if they are the same. If something has zero risk, that means it has no upside either. If you want to emphasize the asymmetric feeling towards loss, that is related to prospect theory. Overall, many discussions read like a hodgepodge of ideas here and there.

For those who want to play with cellular automata, but do not have access to Mathematica, this reader has found that spreadsheets can be formatted to show a relatively small number of steps and how changes to the rules and initial conditions change the patterns.  While Dr. Wolfram shows that the most amazing patterns occur after thousands or millions of steps, you can still get into a feel for it by playing around with your own models.  The book contains everything you need to do it yourself.  In short order, you will appreciate his 20 years of working with these programs.",159

Also if you are considering buying this book be aware that it was written in 2012 before Windows 10 was a thing, so a lot of the tools that are being used will display information very differently, even when you follow along exactly with the book.  This is illustrated by the example using the Resource Hacker tool to examine the calc.exe program (page 25).  When you do this in a Windows 10 environment, it looks nothing like the book example.  I would suggest a virtual machine image of Windows 7 or XP or something like that when working through these examples.

Most statistics curriculums focus on calculations  and cramming a bunch of concepts down a student’s throat. While that’s fine and all, I’ve always strived to drive home the point of “why and HOW could I use this in a practical sense, and what am I being taught that’s truly practical in most situations?” This book covers just that…it’s no lie that most students will move on from statistics and forget most things, but the conceptual parts of this book are what make statistics more memorable and could be great points to bring up in a statistics course to make students better and more informed consumers of statistics (and will hopefully better prepare those who are going to go to grad school, as I suffered the fate of not having a good stats background in my undergrad years).

Also, often when we encounter something that seems complex, we take it for granted that the phenomenon must be the result of an underlying mechanism that is itself complex. The author shows us how simple programs can, in fact, produce great complexity. In regards to physics, the author states, “that thinking in terms of simple programs will make it possible to construct a single truly fundamental theory of physics, from which space, time, quantum mechanics and all the other known feature of our universe will emerge.” We learn in this book, through virtually hundreds of pages of diagrams, how simple initial conditions can produce complex behavior.

Newton's laws. Maxwell's equations. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Things behaved in a certain way because the law was embedded into them. This point of view is the expression of Christian reductionism (In the beginning was the word.....), that within the seemingly sinful random behavior of real things, that there was an expression of some deeper reality. If the hybridization of red and white sweet peas didn't result in 25% of their offspring being red, but rather 23% or 28%, it didn't matter - the principle of an autosomal recessive trait was the same, and the genetic truth was in itself unchanging. Wolfram turns science on its ear by demonstrating how reality is in some way an expression of the chaos embedded in all behaviors. Perturb some supersymmetry, and all reality is generated. The behavior of nuclei and stars, the leaf of a maple tree, the behavior of socieites. Tweak the void with a tiny change, and like a dinner-bell, voila! all reality is served up. This book is not for the faint of heart, but just about every page is provocative. One will find much to consider, and, like the good meal alluded above, digestion will take far longer than the eating.  A tour of Wolfram's software child, Mathematica may help this sometimes baffling reexpression of all science, but is not necessary. Like listening to Beethoven, in which a degree in music appreciation is unnecessary but helpful, formal mathematics opens the door of Wolfram's work a reality unavailable without it, but is in no way necessary to see the beauty of his approach.

One could say it's geared towards the former with a little bit of the latter mixed in.

The most insidious of all - the author is actually intellectually challenged and fails to understand some of the basics of the premises of the idea he is stealing.

But there was also a great deal of material that felt like filler, and a great amount that came across as blatant self-promotion . I suppose it could be argued that all the examples of the author’s stellar success was his way of both providing his credentials and encouraging the reader, but nary a chapter went by without a pitch for the author’s services, name-dropping a VIP he helped —sometimes re-visiting that VIP story more than once — or a reference to his website or company. I came away feeling as if I had visited a used car lot on the way home from a carnival midway - huckstered halfway to madness and all the way to my cringe point. I was left in need of a shower to wash off a certain sense of oily smarminess, and a firm conviction that I would rather remain poor and obscure if the price of success was to become like THAT.",170

I have recently found out that even when you think you are being intentional with your athletes, there is always more to do and accomplish.  This book gives tangible advice from many leadership books and great leaders.  I often ignored books on ""Culture"" because, in my mind, our program was a family.  We have guys coming back and investing and I thought that meant we were getting through to our athletes.  However, after reading JP's book, I realized we have a long way to go as a program and as a place to develop young men.  If you are a coach or a leader of any kind, please read this book.  There are so many things that one would think are obvious but have never though to implement.  I can't wait to use these examples and suggestions to become more intentional with our student athletes.

The images are way too small and low resolution (even using magnifying readers the highly detailed reference images are blurry and unreadable).

The book is what it says it is, a straightforward hands-on introduction to Bayesian methods using a probabilistic programming approach (via PyMC). However, the book does two things that I think don't give it much use for regular practitioners. First, it does a poor job of showing the mathematical formalism of the examples/topics and connecting it to the actual code. This is a problem since it's easy to just run the provided scripts and assume you know what they are doing when you really don't so you can't then adopt it for some other problem. I found many times I was spending more time than I'd like looking over the code trying to figure out what the was actually being done, whereas if the math formalism was available I think it would have been straightforward. The second is that when reading the code in the book the author assumes you will know what all the function and method calls correspond to. This works if I'm content switching back-and-forth between reading the book and browsing the scipy.stats and pymc documentation, but that's obnoxious if I just want to read the book. Author could have put a glossary or margin notes to explain these function and method calls.",201

The book is what it says it is, a straightforward hands-on introduction to Bayesian methods using a probabilistic programming approach (via PyMC). However, the book does two things that I think don't give it much use for regular practitioners. First, it does a poor job of showing the mathematical formalism of the examples/topics and connecting it to the actual code. This is a problem since it's easy to just run the provided scripts and assume you know what they are doing when you really don't so you can't then adopt it for some other problem. I found many times I was spending more time than I'd like looking over the code trying to figure out what the was actually being done, whereas if the math formalism was available I think it would have been straightforward. The second is that when reading the code in the book the author assumes you will know what all the function and method calls correspond to. This works if I'm content switching back-and-forth between reading the book and browsing the scipy.stats and pymc documentation, but that's obnoxious if I just want to read the book.

Although I am a highly analytical person, I found the analytical analyses (e.g. pages 86 through 93) both confusing and simplistic. The calculations of a risk index and risk ratio are easy to do, but the interpretations in the field I learned them in (epidemiology) required a great deal of context to see through questions of confounding and causality to get to the right interpretation. I think it is presented briefly here as to not overwhelm the reader, but that brevity may do injustice to using data properly. Perhaps this could have been two books, one covering important ideas of colorblindness, deficit-thinking, and the many other ways we as individuals, institutions, and a society fail too many of our children. Then the analytical ""book"" could have gone into the data along with interpretation. Not every school fits the same model and we could explore more completely some pitfalls of cursory data analysis.

Anyone who has worked on production systems knows that keeping them running is a challenge, and the key to that problem is knowing what is happening. Here is where the observability approach differs. Instead of just adding more logs, more metrics, and more alerts, observability systems monitor the flow of data through the system, using sampling to control volume, and show you how your users/customers experience your system in real time.",230

If you really are interested in learning C++, I'd definitely recommend this book. The only downside, of course, is the price of this book which at my time of buying sat at ~$230.

I am glad that I made the decision to buy this book!  It turns out to be a great asset, helping me to think strategically about how to evaluate data value, how to frame an analytic project, and more importantly, the economics laws that drive the digital transformation of the whole world. I love this best from the book: "" it isn’t the volume of data that one monetizes, it’s the granularity at the level of the individual that one monetizes.""

Easy to apply advice for communicating with bosses/clients (and anyone really).","2021-02-23","I finally realized I needed to find the tools to be better at storytelling recently when I had 5 minutes with my boss’s boss to fill him in on a big project. Instead of succinctly giving him the synopsis of the project (and my involvement in it!), I stumbled around without succinctly communicating the highlights, and hung up going - ugh. I just really blew an easy opportunity to impress him. I set out to find help with this kind of thing and found Everyday Business Storytelling...I want to shout from the rooftops what a wonderful “secret sauce” this is to delivering in those moments! The tips, tricks, and insights have already helped me speak more confidently (and impressively, I must say) in meetings and I’m only a few pages in! Highly highly recommend for anyone who works in an office/team setting. Easy to absorb. Functional tactics that you can apply to all types of moments with clients and internal stakeholders, even with the most basic things like sending an email.

However, the book also seems to rely heavily on an accompanying website that requires an access code.  I paid approximately $90.00 for the book and assumed an access code to the website would be included but no access code came with the book.  So, I signed up for a one-week free trail of the website after which I would be billed approximately an additional $120.00.  I assumed I now would have access to the materials that accompany the book.  But I did not.  When I clicked on the book’s image at that website I was asked for an access code.  I asked a representative at the website about the access code via instant messaging.  She said I would need to ask Amazon about the access code.  The book actually was sold by Unleash-Inc.
