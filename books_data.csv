There's just what you need, and no more. The differences between every single SQL variant (MS SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, etc). The practice problems are set up with Microsoft SQL Server, and the differences are minor and easy to find online. Details on Insert, Update and Delete statements. The hardest thing to learn in SQL is how to write Select statements that return complex data. Other components of SQL are relatively easy. ""I have numerous books on SQL, and have taken courses from people with lots of experience with data and SQL. Alas, knowing the material is not the same as being able to present it clearly and in digestible bites. Obviously, you have that knack. I have learned things from your book that nobody ever showed me before. I sincerely hope that you will write more books."" - H. V ""I am starting from scratch, all self-taught so far in SQL, and was picking up the syntax and wording, but I could not find anything to give me real world application and scenarios. This book changed that! Great book, great problems, really makes you think ."" -M.G. I've been working with data for more than 20 years, as a database programmer/architect and data scientist, working at organizations like Expedia, Microsoft, T-Mobile, and the Gates Foundation. In 2015, I was teaching a SQL Server Certificate course at the University of Washington Continuing Education. It was a 10 week course, and my students paid more than $1000 for it. My students learned the basics of SQL, most of the keywords, and worked through practice problems every week of the course. But because of the emphasis on getting a broad overview of all features of SQL, we didn't spend nearly enough time on the type of SQL that's used 95% of the time--intermediate and advanced Select statements. After the course was over, many of my students emailed me to ask where they could get more real-world problems. That's when I was inspired to start work on SQL Practice Problems. Thank you so much to everyone who's contacted me with feedback. I've heard from so many people that working their way through SQL Practice Problems was what really made the difference in understanding SQL. Hearing from you is what keeps me motivated to continue updating and improving the content.",4.4,530,"Independently published (March 13, 2017)","English","125","11.2 ounces","7.5 x 0.32 x 9.25 inches"

136,"Expected Goals: The story of how data conquered football and changed the game forever","Rory Smith",13.59,"Shortlisted for the William Hill Sports Book of the Year Award 2022 Football has always measured success by what you win, but only in the last twenty years have clubs started to think about  how  you win. Data has now suffused almost every aspect of how football is played, coached, scouted and consumed. But it’s not the algorithms or new metrics that have made this change, it’s the people behind them. This is the story of modern football’s great data revolution and the group of curious, entrepreneurial personalities who zealously believed in its potential to transform the game.

153,"How Highly Effective People Speak: How High Performers Use Psychology to Influence With Ease (Speak for Success)","Peter Andrei",20.69,"Why do we think what we think? Think we know what we think we know? Believe what we believe? Like what we like? Do what we do?  Why do others trust or distrust us? Respect or disrespect us? Listen to or ignore us? Reach out to or neglect us? Like or dislike us? Praise or slander us? Believe or doubt us? That's not all... Why do others follow our lead or stand in our way? Give us opportunities or send them elsewhere? Support our striving for success and appreciate our message or toss it – and us – aside? Decades of cutting-edge (but unheard-of) scientific research presents an answer... Because hidden, little-known secrets of psychology influence everything about us... Neglecting them is swimming upstream. You can't change minds, win friends, or influence people. You can't earn undivided attention or get the respect you deserve. You undermine your professional image, stagnate your career, and destroy your confidence until communication makes you anxious. You don't deserve this. Neither did I. I remember wondering, ""Why do people never support my ideas? Why am I drowning in a sea of 'sorry, maybe later' (AKA never)? Why have I stopped succeeding?"" Luckily, everything changed when I answered one question... What are the communication habits of highly effective people? It comes down to one secret: Highly effective people speak how the human mind evolved to interpret information. The result? They easily persuade and instantly influence, turning communication from an obstacle into an opportunity. They enrich their careers, get more done, and advance with stunning speed. They impact and inspire others, rising to positions of leadership. They quickly succeed, excel with ease, and shape the world. They attract support, feel confident, and smash goal after goal. Who are they? Presidents and CEOs; top-performers and respected professionals; leaders and visionaries. And here's my question to you: Will you be one of them? In  How Highly Effective People Speak , you'll discover  194 communication habits  of highly effective people (proven by  57 scientific studies ) including: How to get more done with less effort by influencing others to support you How to attract others (instead of turning them away and seeming unfriendly) with the correct type of body language How to make people systematically, predictably, and reliably overweigh your opinion by activating the availability bias How to charge more or pay less (for the same product) and win every negotiation with the anchoring effect How to effortlessly make others want something by activating one little-known cognitive bias (called ""essential"" by billionaire investor Charlie Munger, partner to Warren Buffet) How to lead with ease and reliably influence teams by using the contrast effect How to effortlessly speak with memorable eloquence by applying 2,000-year-old secrets of powerful language How to ace every interview, meeting, and presentation with ease by activating agent detection bias How to quickly diffuse all objections by activating the little-known (but extremely powerful) zero-risk bias How to make people believe something even if they think the exact opposite with the illusory truth effect How to appear authoritative, trustworthy, and capable in 10 seconds by activating the halo effect How to combine the science of psychology with the art of communication and create a critical competitive advantage in life",4.3,1301,"Independently published (May 29, 2020)","English","289","11.9 ounces","5.5 x 0.66 x 8.5 inches"

A lot of people know who they are, what they do, and a few even know why they do it—but even when brands or individuals have clarity in these areas, they often struggle to grab a potential audience’s attention for long enough to get them to learn about their attributes. Others have amazing products or services that fail to achieve great success because they don't know how to talk about what they do effectively. This is because digital and social media have reshaped our world into one of micro-attention. There are over sixty billion messages shared on digital platforms each day, and the average person is exposed to between four thousand to ten thousand ads a day. This bombardment of stimuli has changed the way we communicate and market content both online and off. In fact, research shows that you have less than three seconds to capture a person’s attention. With such a short window of time, we need to hook audiences quickly, efficiently, and consistently if we want to successfully fuel brand awareness and growth.

Combining ‘how to think’ instruction with a ‘how to produce’ mentality, this book takes readers step-by-step through analysing, designing, and curating information into useful, impactful tools of communication. With this book and its extensive collection of online support, readers can: Decide what visualisations work best for their data and their audience using the chart gallery See data visualisation in action and learn the tools to try it themselves Follow online checklists, tutorials, and exercises to build skills and confidence Get advice from the UK’s leading data visualisation trainer on everything from getting started to honing the craft. Many books focus on using software to visualise data but fewer consider good design. Data Visualisation addresses this in an inherently practical way. This is a much needed book which recognises and clarifies the process of designing excellent graphics. What do we actually mean when we talk about Data Visualisation? How do we ′do it’? How can we ensure our research using Data Visualisation is effective and ethical? The answers are all here in this inspirational and invaluable guide. Everything I loved in the first edition of this valuable book has been incorporated into the second, including Kirk’s typology of data visualisation and masses of visual examples, but with more precise written arguments.  This volume continues to fill the gap between overwhelming data and the visualisations that can facilitate understanding. In this second edition, Andy adds relevant content to what was already a fantastic framework for learning the fundamentals of data visualization, all with acute and critical eyes. As an educator, I find it an invaluable resource to students and myself alike. While most works in this space focus on data journalism, scientific visualisations or other specialist audiences, this book targets decision makers and helps with everything from initial concepts and data preparation to editorial layouts. A refreshing angle and a compelling read. Andy Kirk is a UK-based data visualisation specialist. He has been a freelance professional since founding Visualising Data Ltd in 2011 and has been the editor of award-winning website www.visualisingdata.com since 2010.

201,"Bayesian Methods for Hackers: Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Inference (Addison-Wesley Data & Analytics)","Cameron Davidson-Pilon",39.98,"Master Bayesian Inference through Practical Examples and Computation–Without Advanced Mathematical Analysis Bayesian methods of inference are deeply natural and extremely powerful. However, most discussions of Bayesian inference rely on intensely complex mathematical analyses and artificial examples, making it inaccessible to anyone without a strong mathematical background. Now, though, Cameron Davidson-Pilon introduces Bayesian inference from a computational perspective, bridging theory to practice–freeing you to get results using computing power. Bayesian Methods for Hackers  illuminates Bayesian inference through probabilistic programming with the powerful PyMC language and the closely related Python tools NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. Using this approach, you can reach effective solutions in small increments, without extensive mathematical intervention. Davidson-Pilon begins by introducing the concepts underlying Bayesian inference, comparing it with other techniques and guiding you through building and training your first Bayesian model. Next, he introduces PyMC through a series of detailed examples and intuitive explanations that have been refined after extensive user feedback. You’ll learn how to use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, choose appropriate sample sizes and priors, work with loss functions, and apply Bayesian inference in domains ranging from finance to marketing. Once you’ve mastered these techniques, you’ll constantly turn to this guide for the working PyMC code you need to jumpstart future projects. Coverage includes • Learning the Bayesian “state of mind” and its practical implications • Understanding how computers perform Bayesian inference • Using the PyMC Python library to program Bayesian analyses • Building and debugging models with PyMC • Testing your model’s “goodness of fit” • Opening the “black box” of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to see how and why it works • Leveraging the power of the “Law of Large Numbers” • Mastering key concepts, such as clustering, convergence, autocorrelation, and thinning • Using loss functions to measure an estimate’s weaknesses based on your goals and desired outcomes • Selecting appropriate priors and understanding how their influence changes with dataset size • Overcoming the “exploration versus exploitation” dilemma: deciding when “pretty good” is good enough • Using Bayesian inference to improve A/B testing • Solving data science problems when only small amounts of data are available Cameron Davidson-Pilon  has worked in many areas of applied mathematics, from the evolutionary dynamics of genes and diseases to stochastic modeling of financial prices. His contributions to the open source community include lifelines, an implementation of survival analysis in Python.

In fact, by following a simple “fill-in-the-blank” formula, you could potentially save up to 10, 20, or even 50 hours every month by using ChatGPT to write emails, prepare for meetings, and hire employees. This unique method takes advantage of the same principles that control how ChatGPT behaves. And with a few basic commands, it allows you to instantly unlock the full capabilities of ChatGPT and transform it into your own dedicated business assistant. It’s called the “Business Brain Method” and it relies on a completely different approach to communicating with ChatGPT that even so-called “gurus” aren’t aware of. Even with all the media coverage and hype surrounding this AI tool, the majority of people still haven’t figured out this method for taking the “training wheels” off ChatGPT. But here’s the truth: Getting ChatGPT to obey you isn’t just about using the right phrases or keywords and it’s more than a matter of providing enough context. When it comes to speeding up your business growth with this chatbot the real key relies on one of the most fundamental rules of AI development: Knowing how to train it. That’s what makes the special method inside this book so different. It taps directly into ChatGPT’s built-in algorithms and lets you train it to perform dozens of tasks in a matter of seconds .

Learning how to solve these problems will give you the skill and confidence to step up in your career. With SQL Practice Problems, you can get that level of experience by solving sets of targeted problems. These aren't just problems designed as syntax examples. These are  the most common problems you encounter when you deal with data . You will get real world practice, with real world data. I'll teach you  how to “think” in SQL , how to analyze data problems, figure out the fundamentals, and work towards a solution that you can be proud of. Can I run SQL Practice Problems on a Mac?  No, it requires a computer with Microsoft Windows. I also offer a Professional package at SQLPracticeProblems.com which is suitable for both Windows and Mac. How important is the real-life, hands-on problem solving that you can find in SQL Practice Problems? You can watch videos online that will walk you through various aspects of databases, and SQL. And you can read up on SQL syntax and keywords, and review sample code. But...to really absorb and be able to apply your learning,  you need to solve real-world problems .

150,"Numerical Methods for Scientists and Engineers (Dover Books on Mathematics)","R. W. Hamming",23.36,"Numerical analysis is a subject of extreme interest to mathematicians and computer scientists, who will welcome this first inexpensive paperback edition of a groundbreaking classic text on the subject. In an introductory chapter on numerical methods and their relevance to computing, well-known mathematician Richard Hamming (""the Hamming code,"" ""the Hamming distance,"" and ""Hamming window,"" etc.), suggests that the purpose of computing is insight, not merely numbers. In that connection he outlines five main ideas that aim at producing meaningful numbers that will be read and used, but will also lead to greater understanding of how the choice of a particular formula or algorithm influences not only the computing but our understanding of the results obtained. The five main ideas involve (1) insuring that in computing there is an intimate connection between the source of the problem and the usability of the answers (2) avoiding isolated formulas and algorithms in favor of a systematic study of alternate ways of doing the problem (3) avoidance of roundoff (4) overcoming the problem of truncation error (5) insuring the stability of a feedback system. In this second edition, Professor Hamming (Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California) extensively rearranged, rewrote and enlarged the material. Moreover, this book is unique in its emphasis on the frequency approach and its use in the solution of problems. Contents include: I. Fundamentals and Algorithms II. Polynomial Approximation- Classical Theory Ill. Fourier Approximation- Modern Theory IV. Exponential Approximation ... and more Highly regarded by experts in the field, this is a book with unlimited applications for undergraduate and graduate students of mathematics, science and engineering.

They are a product of decades of building real-life solutions and relentless learning. They become really good at their trade closer to the retirement age. But most startups are fostered by young entrepreneurs who dare to try but lack the experience. They also lack the $$ to hire a silver-haired architect to join their team from day one. Left to their own faculties, the entrepreneurs and their engineering teams quickly get on the path of learning from their own mistakes. Eventually, they discover this is the most expensive way of learning. Over time they get better, and some become the true masters of the craft – but way too late to make a difference for their early-day projects. This book is meant to break the vicious circle.

Their book should be required for anyone who wishes to believe that nothing much has changed.”  —The Wall Street Journal “Packed with examples, from the nimble-footed who reacted quickly to adapt their businesses, to laggards who lost empires.”  —Financial Times Traditional network television programming has always followed the same script: executives approve a pilot, order a trial number of episodes, and broadcast them, expecting viewers to watch a given show on their television sets at the same time every week. But then came Netflix's  House of Cards . Netflix gauged the show's potential from data it had gathered about subscribers' preferences, ordered two seasons without seeing a pilot, and uploaded the first thirteen episodes all at once for viewers to watch whenever they wanted on the devices of their choice. In this book, Michael Smith and Rahul Telang, experts on entertainment analytics, show how the success of  House of Cards  upended the film and TV industries—and how companies like Amazon and Apple are changing the rules in other entertainment industries, notably publishing and music. We're living through a period of unprecedented technological disruption in the entertainment industries. Just about everything is affected: pricing, production, distribution, piracy.
